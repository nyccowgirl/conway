The Chaos Cell is similar to the Conway Cell except that it is alive if a random number is even, and if not, it follows
the regular rules. At first this seems simple as to whether it is alive or not and oscillates on or off. However, once
it starts to hit into other cells, it creates chaos with the other cells.
